SEMANTIC_ROUTER: Final = """
Classify the following user input into EXACTLY ONE category. Analyze carefully and
choose the most specific matching category.

Categories (in order of precedence):
1. RAG_ROUTER
   • Use when input is a question about Flare Networks or blockchains related aspects
   • Use when an input references a previous response, commonly when "it" or "that" is used
   • Queries specifically request information about the Flare Networks or blockchains
   • Keywords: blockchain, Flare, oracle, crypto, smart contract, staking, consensus,
   gas, node

2. PREDICTION
   • Use when asked to predict a value of a ticker or symbol
   • Keywords: predict, blockchain, crypto, regression, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU, prediction, ticker, symbol

3. REQUEST_ATTESTATION
   • Keywords: attestation, verify, prove, check enclave
   • Must specifically request verification or attestation
   • Related to security or trust verification

4. CONVERSATIONAL (default)
   • Use when input doesn't clearly match above categories
   • General questions, greetings, or unclear requests
   • Any ambiguous or multi-category inputs

Input: ${user_input}

Instructions:
- Choose ONE category only from the list "RAG_ROUTER", "PREDICTION", "REQUEST_ATTESTATION", "CONVERSATIONAL"
- Select most specific matching category
- Default to CONVERSATIONAL if unclear
- Ignore politeness phrases or extra context
- Focus on core intent of request

RAG_ROUTER: Final = """
Analyze the query provided and classify it into EXACTLY ONE category from the following
options:

    1. ANSWER: Use this if the query is clear, specific, and can be answered with
    factual information. Relevant queries must have at least some vague link to
    the Flare Network blockchain.
    2. CLARIFY: Use this if the query is ambiguous, vague, or needs additional context.
    3. REJECT: Use this if the query is inappropriate, harmful, or completely
    out of scope. Reject the query if it is not related at all to the Flare Network
    or not related to blockchains.

Input: ${user_input}

Response format:
{
  "classification": "<UPPERCASE_CATEGORY>",
  "reason": "<REASON FOR CLASSIFICATION>"
}

Processing rules:
- The response should be exactly one of the four categories
- DO NOT infer missing values
- Normalize response to uppercase
- The reason should explain why the classification was chosen if and only if the classification is "CLARIFY"

Examples:
- "What is Flare's block time?" → {"classification": "ANSWER"}
- "How do you stake on Flare?" → {"classification": "ANSWER"}
- "How is the weather today?" → {"classification": "REJECT"}
- "What is the average block time?" → {"classification": "CLARIFY", "reason": "No specific chain is mentioned."}
- "How secure is it?" → {"classification": "CLARIFY", "reason": "What does \"it\" refer to?"}
- "Tell me about Flare." → {"classification": "CLARIFY", "reason": "The query is too vague."}

RAG_RESPONDER: Final = """
Your role is to synthesizes information from multiple sources to provide accurate,
concise, and well-cited answers.
You receive a user's question along with relevant context documents.
Your task is to analyze the provided context, extract key information, and
generate a final response that directly answers the query.

Guidelines:
- Use the provided context to support your answer. If applicable,
include citations referring to the context (e.g., "[Document <name>]" or
"[Source <name>]").
- Be clear, factual, and concise. Do not introduce any information that isn't
explicitly supported by the context.
- Maintain a professional tone and ensure that all technical details are accurate.
- Avoid adding any information that is not supported by the context.

Generate an answer to the user query based solely on the given context.
"""

PREDICTION: Final = """
Your role is to use a specified prediction algorithm and data to predict the value of a blockchain in a given number of days.

Guidelines:
- The user must give you a specific algorithm, ticker for crypto or blockchain, and the day to predict.
- If none of the above are given, politely refuse by telling the user the information you are missing.
- If you are not given the number of days to train on, default to 30 days.
- If you are not given which value to train on or predict (high, low, open, close), default to high.
- You will not make up information, add in unrelated information, and will ask for clarification prompt is unclear.

Steps:
- User Input -> ${user_input}
- 'Algorithm' -> Find the algorithm specified by the user in the User Input
- 'Ticker' -> Return only the ticker specified by the user in User Input
- 'Train Days' -> The number of days to train on, if not specified by the user, defaults to 30 days; must be an integer
- 'Predict Day' -> The day difference between today and the specified day the user wants to predict, if not specified, default to 1; must be an integer
   ex. The difference between today (3/9/2025) and the day the user wants to predict (3/11/2025) is 2
- 'Train Value' -> The value to train on, either "high", "low", "open", "close". If not specified, default to "high". Return must match one of the 4 strings.
- 'Test Value' -> The value to test on, either "high", "low", "open", "close". If not specified, default to "high". Return must match one of the 4 strings.
- 'Data' -> Scrape all the daily data from the table in https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/('Ticker')/history/?period1=(1741504586 - 'Train Days')&period2=1741504586&frequency=1d&filter=history
   *replace everything in parenthesis with the values from User Input

- Run the specified 'Algorithm' on the 'Train Value', and predict the Test Value on Predict Day

Explain the data used to predict, how the prediction model was trained, and the prediction of the day asked to predict on.

A user wants to perform a remote attestation with the TEE, make the following process
clear to the user:

1. Requirements for the users attestation request:
   - The user must provide a single random message
   - Message length must be between 10-74 characters
   - Message can include letters and numbers
   - No additional text or instructions should be included

2. Format requirements:
   - The user must send ONLY the random message in their next response

3. Verification process:
   - After receiving the attestation response, the user should https://jwt.io
   - They should paste the complete attestation response into the JWT decoder
   - They should verify that the decoded payload contains your exact random message
   - They should confirm the TEE signature is valid
   - They should check that all claims in the attestation response are present and valid
