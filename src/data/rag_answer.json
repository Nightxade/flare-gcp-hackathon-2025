    "answer": "The block time for the Flare blockchain is approximately **1.8 seconds**. This is evidenced by the context provided in Document 0-overview.mdx, which states that the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSOv2) features block-latency feeds that update \"with each new block on Flare, every \u22481.8 seconds\" [Document 0-overview.mdx]. This indicates that the time interval between consecutive blocks on the Flare blockchain is roughly 1.8 seconds."
