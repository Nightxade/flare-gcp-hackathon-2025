# What Is Flare?[#](https://docs.flare.network/tech/flare/#what-is-flare
""Permanent link"")

[](https://docs.flare.network/assets/images/dev/reference/logo-FLR.png)

Flare is the blockchain for data. It is a [layer
1](https://docs.flare.network/tech/glossary/#layer1),
[EVM](https://docs.flare.network/tech/glossary/#evm) [smart
contract](https://docs.flare.network/tech/glossary/#smart_contract) platform
designed to expand the utility of blockchain.

Flare's aim is to provide data as a public good, meaning that data is not
controlled by a centralized entity and is available to all. The infrastructure
providers, which perform doubly as
[validators](https://docs.flare.network/tech/validators/) and data providers,
enable two native [oracles](https://docs.flare.network/tech/glossary/#oracle),
the [FTSO](https://docs.flare.network/tech/ftso/) and the [Flare Data
Connector](https://docs.flare.network/tech/data-connector/). This
[native](https://docs.flare.network/tech/glossary/#native) processing provides
developers on Flare with efficient access to large amounts of data and [data
proofs](https://docs.flare.network/tech/glossary/#data_proof) at minimal cost,
with which to build software on the platform.

By giving developers
[trustless](https://docs.flare.network/tech/glossary/#trustless) access to the
broadest range of data needed by the software they build, Flare can advance
the development of more blockchain use cases where data is important, such as
in [DeFi](https://docs.flare.network/tech/glossary/#defi), gaming,
[NFT](https://docs.flare.network/tech/glossary/#nft), music, social networks,
Real World Assets [(RWAs)](https://docs.flare.network/tech/glossary/#rwa),
Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

## Flare Protocols[#](https://docs.flare.network/tech/flare/#flare-protocols
""Permanent link"")

Flare has the following native data acquisition protocols at these stages of
development:

  * The [Flare Time-Series Oracle (FTSO)](https://docs.flare.network/tech/ftso/) provides continuous estimations of changing data, such as [price pairs](https://docs.flare.network/tech/glossary/#price_pair).
  * The [Flare Data Connector](https://docs.flare.network/tech/data-connector/) allows querying of verifiable, non-changing data from other chains and the internet.
  * The [FAssets](https://dev.flare.network/fassets/overview) system is being developed by Flare Labs. It allows tokens on blockchains that do not support smart contracts to be used trustlessly with smart contracts on the Flare blockchain.

## Developing on Flare[#](https://docs.flare.network/tech/flare/#developing-
on-flare ""Permanent link"")

For information about developing on Flare, see the [Flare Developer
Hub](https://dev.flare.network/).

## Flare Networks[#](https://docs.flare.network/tech/flare/#flare-networks
""Permanent link"")

Flare has 4 networks with different purposes:

  * Flare is the [main network](https://docs.flare.network/tech/glossary/#main_network), where `$FLR` is the native currency.
  * Songbird is the [canary network](https://docs.flare.network/tech/glossary/#canary_network), where `$SGB` is the native currency. Created with users in mind, it is meant for testing features under ""real fire"" conditions, before deploying them on the main network.
  * Coston is Songbird's public [test network](https://docs.flare.network/tech/glossary/#coston), created with developers in mind.
  * Coston2 is Flare's public [test network](https://docs.flare.network/tech/glossary/#coston), created with developers in mind.

General feature adoption flow.

## Flare Chains[#](https://docs.flare.network/tech/flare/#flare-chains
""Permanent link"")

Flare uses two chains and is developing a built-in interoperability mechanism
between them.

  * C-Chain: The contract chain that is used for smart contracts. It is where the Ethereum Virtual Machine operates, and is the chain where the vast bulk of the community currently interact.
  * P-Chain: The platform chain that accommodates [staking](https://docs.flare.network/tech/validators/) and provides rewards to its validators.
